This is a developer release so installation is not yet user friendly.

You will need to compile LabLOVE yourself. To do this you will need
the following:

* CMake (http://www.cmake.org)
* Lua (http://www.lua.org)
* Artist (http://sourceforge.net/projects/artist)

Then do:

$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./lablove

Edit default.lua to change the experiment to be run.
